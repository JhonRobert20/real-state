## Requirements

 * [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

## About
Welcome to the Real state backend project!
- In this project I want to show you how to build a backend for a real state website.
- The backend is built with Django and Fast api - container web.
- The database is PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- The views contain login, logout, register and a list of estates.
- The API contains endpoints for the estates.
- There is a command to populate the database with fake data.
- The most interesting part of this project is how the django app is communicated with the fast api app.
- Please read all the documentation to understand how to use the project.
- Please, check the TODO section to see what I would like to improve in the future.
